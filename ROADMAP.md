# Roadmap

Real future features, not yet started. For small deferred decisions/known
edge cases see [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md); for what's already shipped see
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Browser-profile chat capture (LOW — only if there's real demand)
- Problem: the Claude desktop app collector (`collect_from_claude_desktop()`,
  see CHANGELOG.md's full investigation) only reads the Windows desktop
  app's own local Chromium profile — it has no visibility into
  conversations opened only via a regular browser tab at claude.ai. The
  current user doesn't use claude.ai via browser (Claude Code + desktop
  app only), so this gap doesn't affect their own usage — but if this
  project goes public, other users' workflows may lean on the browser
  more, and Web Chat Import's manual-export safety net is a worse
  experience for someone used to the desktop app's automatic capture.
- Same underlying technique as the already-solved desktop-app collector
  (LevelDB + Snappy + V8 SerializedScriptValue decode, see CHANGELOG.md's
  "Claude desktop app chat capture" investigation) — Chrome/Edge's own
  IndexedDB storage for the claude.ai origin, same copy-before-read
  discipline (browsers hold a LevelDB single-writer lock while running).
  The hard part (the Snappy-compression bug in `ccl_chromium_reader`)
  is already solved and the fix already lives in `src/collector.py`'s
  `_idb_ssv_decode()` — a browser-profile collector would likely reuse
  that decoder directly, with a different profile-path lookup per
  browser instead of the MSIX-specific Electron path.
- Real complication not present in the desktop-app case: a regular
  browser profile is shared across every site the user visits, not just
  claude.ai — the IndexedDB database lookup needs to correctly scope to
  the `https://claude.ai` origin specifically (the desktop app's profile
  only ever has that one origin, simplifying the original collector).
- Not scheduled until there's a real signal it's wanted (a public user
  request, or the current user's own usage pattern changing) — Web Chat
  Import already covers this as a manual safety net in the meantime.

*(Android + iOS chat capture — shipped 2026-08-06, see CHANGELOG.md.
`cli.py android-connect <ip>:<port>` + `cli.py collect --source
claude-android` now works for real, including reading iPhone-originated
conversations via the shared account sync. See README.md/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
for setup instructions, split by whether you're using your own Android
phone or an old/spare Android device purely as an iPhone bridge.)*
