# Roadmap

Real future features, not yet started. For small deferred decisions/known
edge cases see [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md); for what's already shipped see
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

---

## Mobile TOTP re-provisioning (MEDIUM)
- Problem: setting up a *new* device (`--join-device`) already shows the
  TOTP QR code as part of the flow, but there's no way to get that QR
  back onto a phone later without redoing full device setup — e.g. a lost
  phone, a phone reset, or wanting to add Google Authenticator on a
  second phone. Moved here from BACKLOG.md 2026-08-06: this was
  previously "not currently worth fixing," but with the mobile access
  flow (README's "Access from Mobile" section) being a real, actively
  used part of the project, it's worth actually solving rather than
  leaving as permanent friction.
- `src/crypto.py` already derives/holds the TOTP secret for an
  already-set-up device — the missing piece is a way to re-display that
  secret's QR code on demand (a CLI command, e.g. `cli.py show-totp-qr`,
  or a button in the web UI's device settings) without re-running the
  full `--join-device` flow.
- Security note: re-displaying an existing TOTP secret is different from
  generating a new one — should require the same passphrase+TOTP
  confirmation `--join-device` already demands before showing anything,
  not be reachable without proving you already have access.

## Browser-profile chat capture (LOW — only if there's real demand)
- Problem: the Claude desktop app collector (`collect_from_claude_desktop()`,
  see CHANGELOG.md's full investigation) only reads the Windows desktop
  app's own local Chromium profile — it has no visibility into
  conversations opened only via a regular browser tab at claude.ai. The
  current user doesn't use claude.ai via browser (Claude Code + desktop
  app only), so this gap doesn't affect their own usage — but if this
  project goes public, other users' workflows may lean on the browser
  more, and Web Chat Import's manual-export safety net is a worse
  experience for someone used to the desktop app's automatic capture.
- Same underlying technique as the already-solved desktop-app collector
  (LevelDB + Snappy + V8 SerializedScriptValue decode, see CHANGELOG.md's
  "Claude desktop app chat capture" investigation) — Chrome/Edge's own
  IndexedDB storage for the claude.ai origin, same copy-before-read
  discipline (browsers hold a LevelDB single-writer lock while running).
  The hard part (the Snappy-compression bug in `ccl_chromium_reader`)
  is already solved and the fix already lives in `src/collector.py`'s
  `_idb_ssv_decode()` — a browser-profile collector would likely reuse
  that decoder directly, with a different profile-path lookup per
  browser instead of the MSIX-specific Electron path.
- Real complication not present in the desktop-app case: a regular
  browser profile is shared across every site the user visits, not just
  claude.ai — the IndexedDB database lookup needs to correctly scope to
  the `https://claude.ai` origin specifically (the desktop app's profile
  only ever has that one origin, simplifying the original collector).
- Not scheduled until there's a real signal it's wanted (a public user
  request, or the current user's own usage pattern changing) — Web Chat
  Import already covers this as a manual safety net in the meantime.

*(iOS chat capture was researched exhaustively — see [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md)'s
"Decided, closed" section — and moved there 2026-08-06 as a settled
decision, not a future feature: no automated path exists that doesn't
violate Anthropic's Consumer Terms or require jailbreaking, confirmed
directly by Anthropic's own support channel.)*
